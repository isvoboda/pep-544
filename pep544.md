# PEP 544: Structural Sub-typing

- support for static type checkers
- _minor bonus_ is the possibility to use protocols in runtime
- more _pythonic_ way compared to implemented `__subclasshook__()` of `abc` module

--- 

## Sub-typing

**Nominal** sub-typing

~~~python
class SuperType: ...
class SubType(SuperType): ...
~~~

**Structural** sub-typing

~~~python
class IPoint(Protocol):
    x: int
    y: int

class Point:  # No base class
    x: int
    y: int
~~~

---

## Terminology

~~~python
C = TypeVar('C', bound='IPoint')

@runtime_checkable  # allow isinstance and issubclass in runtime
class IPoint(Protocol):  # Protocol
    x: int  # Protocol data member
    y: int  # Protocol data member

    @classmethod
    def from_tuple(cls, seq: Tuple[int, int]) -> C:  # Protocol non-data member
        pass 
~~~

- Non-data Protocol
- Data Protocol

---

## Explicit vs Implicit Declaration

~~~python
C = TypeVar('C', bound='IPoint')

@runtime_checkable  # allow isinstance and issubclass in runtime
class IPoint(Protocol):  # Protocol
    x: int  # Protocol data member
    y: int  # Protocol data member

    @classmethod
    def from_tuple(cls, seq: Tuple[int, int]) -> C:  # Protocol non-data member
        ...

class ImplicitPoint:
    x: int
    y: int

    @classmethod
    def from_tuple(cls, seq: Tuple[int, int]) -> ImplicitPoint:  # Protocol non-data member
        ...

class ExplicitPoint(IPoint):
    ...
~~~

---

## Limitations at Runtime

~~~python
C = TypeVar('C', bound='IPoint')

@runtime_checkable
class IPoint(Protocol):  # Data protocol
    x: int  # Protocol data member
    y: int  # Protocol data member

@runtime_checkable
class IPointFactory(Protocol):  # Non-data protocol
    @classmethod
    def from_tuple(cls, seq: Tuple[int, int]) -> C:  # Protocol non-data member
        pass

class Point:
    def __init__(x: int, y: int) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class PointFactory:
    def from_tuple(cls, seq: Tuple[int, int]) -> Point: ...

point = Point(0, 0)
factory_point = PointFactory.from_tuple((0, 0))

isinstance(point, IPoint)  # Ok
issubclass(Point, IPoint)  # Error

isinstance(factory_point, IPointFactory)  # Ok
issubclass(PointFactory, IPointFactory)  # Ok
~~~

## Using Protocols

- A protocol is never a subtype of a concrete type
- A concrete type `X` is a subtype of protocol `P` if and only if `X` implements all protocol members of `P` with compatible types
- A protocol `P1` is a subtype of another protocol `P2` if `P1` defines all protocol members of `P2` with compatible types
